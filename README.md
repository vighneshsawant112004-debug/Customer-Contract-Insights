# Key Insights
- Majority Preference: Most customers prefer Month-to-Month contracts, offering flexibility but higher churn risk.
- Stable Revenue: Long-term contracts (One-Year & Two-Year) provide predictable revenue streams.
- Retention Challenge: Heavy reliance on short-term contracts increases vulnerability to churn.
- Growth Opportunity: Incentives and loyalty rewards can convert flexible users to long-term customers.

# Recommendations
- Introduce discounts and loyalty rewards for One-Year and Two-Year contracts.
- Implement targeted retention campaigns for Month-to-Month users.
- Use segmentation-based communication strategies for different contract types.
